📝 One Tap Journal

A minimal daily journaling app built with Flutter.
I made this in about 1 hour — just vibin’ and coding while chilling ✌️

✨ Features

📅 Daily prompt — one simple question each day

✍️ Quick one-line journaling

🕒 History view to revisit past entries

🌙 Dark / Light theme toggle

🎨 Clean, calming UI

That’s it. Nothing crazy, just a little project I put together when I had some free time.
